# Grandma's Attic

Grandma’s Attic is an application that allows users to donate gently used or unused holiday supplies. The perfect application for anyone that wants to clean out their attic or update their holiday decor. The application’s target audience is those whose budget is limited for holiday decorations like schools, nursing homes and shelters. Spread the holiday cheer by donating your seasonal decorations to Grandma’s Attic!

The app can be accessed here(hyperlink). 

## How to Use

Enter the attic ( screen shot)

Either browse items that are up for donation, or claim available items.  

Click donate item (Screen shot)
-fill out the form that appears and leave instructions on how to pick it up 

Select which holiday you would like to browse by (screen shot)

You will be taken to the holiday page, on this page you will see all available items up for grabs.

Each category's page will allow users to claim an item or see if an item has already been claimed.

If you find an item you’d like to pick up, follow the pick-up instructions.

## MVP

Show items available for pick-up in the Austin area.

Allow users to list their own items with pick-up instructions.

Allow users to claim a specific item.

At this point, the app serves as an advertising platform similar to Craigslist (minus the back-and-forth communication) and the free section in the classifieds (updating in real-time). 

## Future Development

User Authentication: allow users to manage claim status (view/update their own listings and/or items they've claimed).

Map layout pinpointing item locations.

Facilitate communication between users.
