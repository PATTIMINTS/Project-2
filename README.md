### Claim Item (screen shot)
* Each category's page will allow users to claim an item or see if an item has already been claimed.
* If you find an item you’d like to pick up, follow the pick-up instructions.

## MVP

Show items available for pick-up in the Austin area.

Allow users to list their own items with pick-up instructions.

Allow users to claim a specific item.

At this point, the app serves as an advertising platform similar to Craigslist (minus the back-and-forth communication) and the free section in the classifieds (updating in real-time). 

## Future Development

* User Authentication: allow users to manage claim status (view/update their own listings and/or items they've claimed).

* Map layout pinpointing item locations.

* Facilitate communication between users.
